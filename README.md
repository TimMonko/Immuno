# Immuno
03/26/2019 ~ The purpose of this guide is to provide a detailed and organized protocol to best facilitate current and future immunohistochemical imaging, processing, and analysis of both the image data and the statistics thereby obtained. Please note that much of this work is reliant on me learning code ad hoc, so many scripts are not optimized or rely on case-specific calls to variables that make the code harder to generalize. As such, I am constantly changing the code so be aware; if I were ever to do a full rewrite of code to be more general and optimized I will be sure to let everyone know. I am working on establishing a GitHub to provide updates to the code and other resources, instead of being reliant on finding the correct file within our internal server.
